# Midnight-Omnis Compatibility Patches
A plugin adding Omnis compatibility to the Midnight Trilogy.

## Requirements
- Omnis
- Lost in Midnight, Midnight Expansion, and/or Midnight Scrapyard
- Endless Sky

Still trying to decide what license I want to use, so I went with GNU General Public License for now. It can (and likely will) change in the future. In the meantime, feel free to issue pull requests for any additional patches you feel are necessary.
